CSTM (pronounced "Custom") is a utility C++ library that is aiming to solve certain "problems" that I have with the STL, and C++ as a language.
It takes inspiration from other languages like Rust and C#, and aims to be both fast, safe and easy to use.

CSTM started development as the Core module of my custom web browser Theia, but I decided that it deserved to be its own project entirely.

## Supported Compilers
Since CSTM requires C++23 it should in theory work with any compiler that fully implements that version of C++, however these are the only compilers that are guaranteed to work with CSTM.
- GCC 14+
- MSVC 19.39.33520
